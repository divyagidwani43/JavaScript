CLONING OBJECTS

const friend2 = Object.assign({}, me);

will create an empty object {} and merge me object to it 
any change in property's value will not reflect in 'me' object
but in array it would reflect in all copies of object as it is deeply nested so USE SPREAD OPERATOR INSTEAD


const friend3 = Object.assign({ DOB: 1992, lastNAme: 'willams' }, me)

will add the mentioned values as well without reflecting any change in any other objects

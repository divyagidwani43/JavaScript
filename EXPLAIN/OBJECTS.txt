OBJECTS
a.firtName = 'john'; 
will change the firstname


console.log(a.age); 
will access age

console.log(a['age']);                                                                                         
calling age from object using bracket notation bracket is solved from left to right but brackets are done first 
fist age is seen then a is compiled inside '' any expression can be put


console.log(a.interestedIn);                                                                                   
will display undefined as Jonas does not have a property called 'interested in', right? And so therefore the result of trying to access 'interested in' on Jonas is undefined.

console.log(a[interestedIn]);                                                                                 
will display correct ,if wrong input given will display undefined , undefined is what we get when we try to access a property on an object that does not exist ,a.[interestedIn] will take value of interestedIn first and it will become a[age]that does exist , it a clever way of asking what data user wants to access from object



a.job = 'teacher';                                                                                             
a['place'] = 'jaipur';
will add property and data

a['friends'].length
a.friends.length

delete a.dk;
delete property and data



a.friends.push('bob');
push into friends array declared in object



console.log(a['calcAge'](1991));
console.log(a.calcAge(1991));
calling function declared in object

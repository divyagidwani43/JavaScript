THIS KEYWORD
point to window obbject if not in strict mode

IN arrow func in objects 
window object in arrow function as it dont get its own this keyword defined
so it uses this keyword definition of global function  i.e window object
arrow function doesnt have this keyword so no matter where it is called it will
have window object in this keyword and values declared by var will hold a place in
window object but let and const wont have the same place in window

in normal function in object
this takes up the value of the object as object not because it is called in obj object 
but because we call the function using obj.a i.e obj calls the function so this takes up the obj value 
console.log(this.age);
so we can use object action on this keyword
will take up jonas object in this keyword


IN REG FUNCTION INSIDE REG FUNCTION
will be undefined as inside any function call this keyword is undefined
SOLU->func3: function () {
        const any_name = this;
        const func4 = function () {
            console.log(any_name)
instead of this use any_name
SOLU->func4: function () {
        console.log('func4 and solving above undefined')
        const func4 = () => {
            console.log(this)
arrow function doesnt have this keyword so for this arrow here this would 
have parent value i.e of the object

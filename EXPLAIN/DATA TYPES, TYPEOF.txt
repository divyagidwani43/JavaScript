DATA TYPES, TYPEOF
automatic detection

//number - has all decimal and non decimal
//string - must be in quotes
//boolean - either true or false
//undefined - variable declared but value not assigned
//null
//symbol (ES2015) - defines a unique value
//bigint - number too large to fit into number type
In static languages, when we declare a
variable, the type of the variable is set and it cannot be changed
in the future. In a dynamic language like JavaScript,
the type of a variable can change at run time.


// typeof shows us the type of data that value holds
console.log(typeof true);

SCOPE CHAIN
global variables can be called inside any function and
all variables in parent function are avaible in child function

if any global var is called in child function it must be declared before the function is called otherwise when the function is called and global var is declared afterwards it would not be accessible to function- refer to code

var created in if can be accessed outside if block but only outside if block not outside function block

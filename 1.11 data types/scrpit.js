//javascript is dynamic ie it recognises the type when we enter the varible value and it need not be specified first
//we can assign one varible to 2 data types ie change its data type in code
//variable value decides data type
/*dynamic languages. In static languages, when we declare a
variable, the type of the variable is set and it cannot be changed
in the future. In a dynamic language like JavaScript,
the type of a variable can change at run time. Let's see this*/
